# TIG

TIG is re-added to the [Arcanum Community Edition](https://github.com/alexbatalov/arcanum-ce).

One of the reasons for extracting TIG into a separate repository was the very small chance that I would work on The Temple of Elemental Evil in the future. Now, it is definitely not going to happen, as SNEG is taking care of ToEE. Therefore, there is literally no point in splitting the code of one game across two repositories.

This repo is archived to retain revision history, and future development has moved to [Arcanum Community Edition](https://github.com/alexbatalov/arcanum-ce).
